<p>I was waiting in the reception area at college and I saw copies of <i>Dawn</i>,<i>Roznama Express</i>, and many other reading material, as well as <cite>Think and Grow Rich</cite>. It is one of my favourite books.</p>

<p>I have soft copy of this book in my laptop as <abbr title= "Portal Document Format">PDF</abbr>.
I often think about the words from the book<q>Anyone who holde a true opinion without understanding is like a blind man on the right road. </q>
I <em>love</em> reading in my spare time.</p>
